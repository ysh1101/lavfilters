LAV Filters are a set of open-source DirectShow filters, aimed to eventually replace the better part of the playback chain required to play all and any modern media.

LAV Splitter is a Souce Filter/Splitter required to demux the files into their separate elementary streams.

LAV Audio and Video Decoder are powerful decoders with a focus on quality and performance, without any compromises.

All LAV Filters are based on the [FFmpeg multimedia libraries](http://www.ffmpeg.org) (licensed under GPLv2)
